    <p>In late January of this year Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, known as ICE, arrested Gunawan Liem and Roby Sanger. Leim, was detained after he dropped his daughter off at a bus stop. Sanger, was detained after he dropped his daughters off
      at school.</p>
    <p>A man third, Harry Pangemanan, was going to get picked up. However, he spotted the ICE agents outside of his home in Highland Park New Jersey and called his pastor.</p>

    <p>Pastor Kaper-Dale of the Reformed Church of Highland Park, drove to Pangemanan’s house and told him to get in the car and drove him to the church.

    <p> Kaper-Dale has been with the Reformed Church of Highland Park since 2001. "When we came to this church there was a small little Indonesian church worshiping at night on Sunday nights," he told NJ.com </p>

    <p>Many of the Christian Indonesians came to the U.S. in the 90’s where they faced religious persecution in the Muslim majority country, nearly 90% of Indonesians identify as Muslim according to the 2010 Indonesian census; only 7% identify as Christians.</p>
