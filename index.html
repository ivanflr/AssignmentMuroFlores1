      In late 2017, a small firestorm was ignited in Middesex County, New Jersey, over four men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of them, Guanwan Liem and Roby Sanger, were detained by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents while transporting their children to and from school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third man, Harry Pangemanan of Highland Park, NJ, was in his driveway on Jan. 25, about to drive his daughter to school, when he noticed a blacked out vehicle on his street. He had seen it the previous day, and knew it to be filled with ICE agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have been picked up like the others, if not for the efforts of the fourth man, Rev. Seth Kaper-Dale.

      Kaper-Dale has presided over the Reformed Church of Highland Park since 2001. He has been fighting to protect his undocumented and asylum seeking parishioners ever since, and offered sanctuary to Pagemanan on that day.

      Places of worship, per ICE’s own internal policy memo, as well as schools, hospitals, and public demonstrations, are classified as “sensitive locations,” at which detentions and arrests are not supposed to occur.
    </p>

    <p>
      He says he’s seen first hand what many across the nation are describing as ICE’s expanded pressure tactics, often involving the surveillance and even attempted entry of these sensitive locations.

      Kaper-Dale’s fight is deeply rooted in his theology. He found the Reformed church through his wife, Rev. Stephanie Kaper-Dale, who is his co-pastor at church, when they first married.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The church we got involved in was a Spanish speaking church in Southwest Michigan with a migrant farm kid turned pastor,” he said. “He was the main influence in my life and the reason i got excited about my faith.”
    </p>
    <p>
      From there, he attended Princeton Seminary and soon after began his ministry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Bible, Kaper-Dale finds justification for his actions against the government in the famous Sermon on the Mount, in the book of Matthew, chapter five.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reverend’s work on immigration is not limited to providing sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      In January 2017, only a few days after newly inaugurated President Trump signed an executive order cracking down on undocumented immigrants and hiring over 10,000 new ICE enforcement personnel, Kaper-Dale founded the Detention and Immigration Response to Emergency Team, or D.I.R.E.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group provides a hotline for anyone who feels they are under threat of detention and deportation, and legal help and visitation programs for those who have already been detained.
    </p>
    <p>
      They also began monitoring courthouse parking lots for ICE agents, after three of their community members were picked up when they tried to pay fines for driving without a license.
    </p>
    <p>
      D.I.R.E.’s model is working, and Kaper-Dale is already reaching out to neighboring communities to see if this network is something that can be duplicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thinks of his work in New Brunswick as “piloting justice.”
