    <p>In late January of this year Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, known as ICE, arrested Gunawan Liem and Roby Sanger. Leim, was detained after he dropped his daughter off at a bus stop. Sanger, was detained after he dropped his daughters off
      at school.</p>
    <p>A man third, Harry Pangemanan, was going to get picked up. However, he spotted the ICE agents outside of his home in Highland Park New Jersey and called his pastor.</p>

    <p>Pastor Kaper-Dale of the Reformed Church of Highland Park, drove to Pangemanan’s house and told him to get in the car and drove him to the church. Pangemanan was seeking sanctuary.

    <p>According to a memo issued by ICE for Field Office Directors there are certain locations that are to be treated as sensitive. The policy is designed to ensure that enforcement actions do not ‘’occur at nor are focused on sensitive locations such as
      schools and churches.’’ </p>

    <p>Despite the fact ICE has a policy explicitly stating that it will not detain people in certain locations it is not without its caveats. Law enforcement officers can enter sensitive sites in cases of exigent circumstances or if “prior approval is obtained.”</p>
